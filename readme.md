# Federated clustering

Federated clustering plays a crucial role in resolving the challenge of clustering non-IID data across devices and organizations (i.e. clients) by leveraging distributed data processing and privacy-preserving techniques, enhancing both efficiency and security.

Although the field holds considerable importance, it has not yet garnered widespread attention.
